	```bash
	email1,password1,proxy1
	email2,password2,proxy2
	```
	if you dont want to use proxy, you don't need to put the proxy.

    ```bash
    node setup.js
    ```
    This script will automatically register account if you don't have account `(You need to check email and open the link to verify the account, after that you can rerun again the script)`. The setup script will automatically fill and save the needed data to the `data.txt`, it will look like this:
    ```bash
    email1,token1,extensionid1,proxy1
